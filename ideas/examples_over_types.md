Absolutely—here’s a deep yet clear explanation of the **examples > types** mentality, weaving in your original quotes from the `readme.md` and tying them to Garden’s core philosophy:

---

## 🌱 **Examples > Types**  
*“It’s much easier for me to generalize from the concrete than concretize from the general.”*  
— *a professor once told me*

This line captures the **examples-first mindset** perfectly.

### 🧠 Traditional Type Systems: General → Specific

Most statically typed languages ask you to **begin with an abstraction**:
- Define the shape of a value (`struct`, `interface`, `class`, etc)
- Then write functions that promise to *always* respect that shape
- Then supply values that must *fit* the declared shape

This works—but it’s upside-down for many people’s minds.

You often don’t know *the shape* of the thing until you’ve *seen it run*.

### 🌾 Garden's Philosophy: Specific → General

In Garden, you start from a **real value**:
- You write an expression
- You see what it *evaluates to*
- That result is cached and viewable side-by-side with the expression
- You can generalize later if needed

It’s like a REPL that **doesn't forget**.

Instead of saying, “this will always return a `Map<String, Int>`,” you say:

```rune
let scores = {"alice": 10, "bob": 12}
```

…and Garden just stores that value. You don’t declare a type—you **show it an example**.

If the values *change* and become heterogeneous later, Garden lets you explore those transitions too.

## 🧾 Quotes from Your README

> “In hindsight, so much of what we hype up as ‘exploratory programming’ in the REPL is really just coping with the lack of useful type information.”

This is the paradox.

The REPL feels *fun*, because it gives **live values**.

But it's also fragile. Once the session ends, those values disappear. You're left with a transcript that doesn't travel with the code.

**Garden fixes this.** It turns exploratory values into stable, cacheable knowledge. The REPL becomes a living document.

---

> “The values of a program deserve to be tracked in git, not just the source of a program.”  
> — *your opinion*

This is the crux of it.

If you believe in “types as documentation,” **then values are better documentation**. They’re precise. They carry edge cases. They show what the code *did*, not just what it *claims* to do.

So Garden doesn't just cache values—it **versions them**.

When you commit code, you’re also committing:
- What each expression evaluated to
- What changed
- Which parts were re-used
- What broke

## 🔍 Summary

### Why **Examples > Types** in Garden:

| Types | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Abstract | Concrete |
| Prescriptive | Descriptive |
| Promise-based | History-based |
| Static | Live |
| Debugger-unfriendly | Inspectable |
| Often theoretical | Always real |

In Garden, code is not a **guess** about the future—it's a **record** of what happened.

From there, you can always generalize.  
But now, you're generalizing from soil, not from blueprints.

Would you like me to mock up a side-by-side view of expression + value + inferred shape, to show this philosophy in action?
