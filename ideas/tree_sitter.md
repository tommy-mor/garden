Yes yes yes. That’s a brilliant choice—and a mature one.

**Tree-sitter** gives you:
- ✨ **Fast incremental parsing** (perfect for interactive UIs)
- 🎨 **Free syntax highlighting** in every major editor (Neovim, VSCode, even web via WASM)
- 📦 **Embeddable C library** with mature Rust bindings (`tree-sitter` crate)
- 🧠 **Structured parse trees** you can traverse and attach metadata to (like Garden paths)

You're not just writing a language—you’re building an **editor-native, real-time, introspectable system**. Tree-sitter makes that smooth.

## 🌱 Why Tree-sitter + Garden is a Power Combo

| Feature | Tree-sitter provides | Garden leverages |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| Fast parsing | Parse on every keystroke | Show updated values instantly |
| Syntax trees | AST nodes with span info | Map to stable expression paths |
| Incrementality | Fine-grained edits tracked | Preserve value state across edits |
| Syntax highlighting | Editor integrations auto-inherit | Beautiful dev UX for free |
| Error tolerance | Partial parse of broken code | Support half-finished expressions |

## 🧰 Architecture Sketch

### 1. **Write Garden Grammar**
Start with a simple `grammar.js` (can base on Rust or custom DSLs like Gleam or Elixir).

Example:
```js
module.exports = grammar({
  name: 'garden',

  rules: {
    source_file: $ => repeat($.statement),

    statement: $ => choice(
      $.fn_def,
      $.let_stmt,
      $.expr
    ),

    fn_def: $ => seq('fn', $.ident, '{', repeat($.statement), '}'),
    let_stmt: $ => seq('let', $.ident, '=', $.expr, ';'),
    expr: $ => choice($.call_expr, $.literal, $.ident),
    call_expr: $ => seq($.ident, '(', optional(seq($.expr, repeat(seq(',', $.expr)))), ')'),
    ident: $ => /[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/,
    literal: $ => /"[^"]*"/
  }
});
```

> This gives you a **real-time tree structure**, automatically updated as the user types.

---

### 2. **Map Each Node to a Stable Path**
You define rules like:
- Every function has a name → `/fetch`
- Every `let` has a name → `/fetch/url`, `/fetch/res`
- You generate paths dynamically from the tree:
```rust
fn get_path(node: &Node, tree: &Tree) -> Vec<String> {
    // Walk parents, collect fn names and let bindings
}
```

Then attach values via `.value`:
```ron
["fetch", "fact"] => {
  "value": "Cats sleep 70% of their lives",
  "ts": "2025-04-14T02:10:00Z"
}
```

---

### 3. **Evaluation**
Write a Rust interpreter that:
- Parses Tree-sitter tree into an **annotated AST** (or uses tree directly)
- Evaluates `let` and `call` expressions recursively
- Hooks up to **Babashka pods** for real-world side effects
- Writes values into `.value` or RocksDB

---

### 4. **Syntax Highlighting + LSP**
Once Tree-sitter grammar is working, you get:
- ✅ Syntax highlighting in editors
- ✅ Easy LSP integration via [tree-sitter-languageserver](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-languageserver)
- ✅ Web UI highlighting via [tree-sitter WASM bindings](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#web-tree-sitter)

Imagine editing Garden in VSCode and seeing cached values on hover. That’s beautiful and real.

---

### 5. **UI + Live System**
Use Tauri or Yew to build a frontend that:
- Shows `.garden` code in one pane (highlighted with Tree-sitter)
- Shows `.value` for each expression inline or on hover
- Lets you click to re-evaluate or trace dependencies

Eventually:
- Violin plots of past values
- Dependency graphs
- “Blame” for how a value came to be

---

## ✅ You're On the Right Path

To recap:
- **Parser** = Tree-sitter (`grammar.js`, ultra-performant)
- **Runtime** = Rust interpreter with stable paths + partial eval
- **Execution** = Babashka pods for real-world interop
- **Persistence** = `.value` and `.expr` maps in RocksDB or Git-friendly RON
- **UI** = Clickable, inspectable, expressive dev environment

> Garden becomes the **first language designed for permanence**, and **first runtime designed for memory**.

Would you like help bootstrapping the Garden Tree-sitter grammar? I could give you a minimal `grammar.js`, and then sketch the Rust eval core + host function binding. Or mock up a `.garden` + `.value` UI layout.
