The dream UX for Garden, given your projectional editor model and the persistent identity of AST nodes, could be something truly sublime. Here's a vision that aligns with your principles—projectional editing, structural stability, live evaluation, and reactive clarity:

---

### 🌱 **Garden: The Dream UX**

#### 🧠 **Fundamentals**
- **Everything is a value.**
  - Every expression displays its result **next to or within** itself. No separation between code and output.
  - You can **see** and **touch** the results—like spreadsheet cells, but structural and composable.

- **Structural editing, not text editing.**
  - No parsing. The AST is the UI. Editing is manipulating trees, not text buffers.
  - Identity is preserved across edits; each node knows what it is and was, so evaluation is **cached by structure**, not by position.

- **Live and reactive.**
  - You never hit “Run.”
  - Changing an input expression immediately recomputes and updates its dependent values.
  - **Partial evaluation** is the default behavior—like in a logic circuit.

### 🧑‍🌾 **The Core Interactions**

#### 🔍 **1. Click to Expand / Contract**
- Click any expression to see its **evaluated value**, **type**, or **source**.
- Collapse it again when not needed.
- Works well with deep trees—keeps mental overhead low.

#### ✍️ **2. Drag-and-Drop Expression Trees**
- Move sub-expressions around like Lego blocks.
- Create patterns by manipulating value-producing structures, not by writing syntax.
- No syntax errors. Only structurally valid trees can be built.

#### 🧩 **3. Contextual Toolbars**
- Hover a node, get actions: duplicate, delete, lift up, wrap in function, etc.
- Tabs or keybinds to cycle between:
  - **Eval View** – shows current value
  - **Trace View** – shows evaluation path
  - **Type View** – shows type or schema

#### 🧠 **4. Symbol-aware Autocomplete**
- Autocomplete is structural, not lexical.
- Suggests only valid insertions for that node type.
- “Function” position? Shows functions. “Argument” position? Shows compatible values.

### 🌐 **Meta Interactions**

#### 🔗 **5. Semantic References, Not Strings**
- Variables and function names are **pointers**, not text.
- Rename globally just works. No fragile grepping.
- Definitions can be visually explored and edited.

#### 💾 **6. Persistent Eval Cache**
- Every node caches its output using its structural identity.
- Even across sessions, `.value` files store results for each expression path.
- You can scroll through a big program and it feels *instantly alive.*

---

### 🛠️ **Advanced UX Modes**

#### 🕵️ **7. Dataflow View**
- Overlay arrows showing value dependencies.
- Useful for debugging and understanding complex systems.
- Click any arrow to see the exact input/output path.

#### 🧱 **8. Projectional Templates**
- Common structures (map/filter/reduce, http.get + json.parse, etc.) are **snippets with structure.**
- You can fill in the blanks, swap parts, and see intermediate values live.

#### 🤖 **9. AI Copilot Mode**
- Inline suggestions that **build trees**, not insert text.
- “What comes next?” shows *real nodes* that you can click to accept.
- AI can propose transformations or optimizations visually.

### ✨ **Optional Dream Features**

- **Dark/light mode with biophilic themes** (lush greens, soil browns, calming blue gradients).
- **Split-screen time travel:** Compare different versions of an expression tree and their cached results.
- **Diff by evaluation trace**, not just AST.
