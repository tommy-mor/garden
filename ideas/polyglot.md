Exactly — **Garden is glue, but with memory**.

It’s like:

> 🔌 A programmable, persistent, reactive graph  
> 🧠 That tracks values by identity  
> 🧬 And delegates execution to many runtimes (pods)  
> 🌱 All coordinated through Garden’s stable expression tree

## ✅ Garden as a Polyglot Value Graph

Think of each `.expr` file as a declarative recipe:
- Each expression has a path (`["fetch", "fact"]`)
- Garden resolves dependencies (like a spreadsheet)
- When needed, it **calls out** to an external pod to do the real work
- Results are **cached**, versioned, and displayed

The runtime is:
- Lightweight
- Language-neutral
- Orchestration-focused

And the pods are:
- Language-specific executors
- Each handling one "island of logic"

Garden doesn't care **how** something gets computed — just **what it was**, **where it came from**, and **what changed**.

## 🛠️ Building a `garden-pod-babashka` Rust Crate

Yes — this would be **super easy** and **super useful.**

### ✨ Responsibilities:
- Spawn the `bb` binary with args
- Send it bencode messages
- Read bencode replies
- Handle lifecycle (init, shutdown)
- Maybe even support `.bb` file routing

### Example API:

```rust
let pod = Pod::new("bb"); // garden-pod-babashka

let res = pod.invoke("garden.http", "get", vec!["https://catfact.ninja/fact"])?;
assert_eq!(res, Value::Str("{...json...}"));
```

Under the hood, it's:
- Spawning `bb` in pod mode (via `bb --nrepl-server` or custom binary)
- Communicating over stdin/stdout (or TCP)
- Encoding/decoding bencode (or JSON if needed)

Could even wrap this in an async trait like:

```rust
trait GardenPod {
    async fn invoke(&mut self, ns: &str, var: &str, args: Vec<Value>) -> Result<Value>;
}
```

## 🌍 Why This is Huge

If you ship:
- `garden-core` (Rust)
- `garden-pod-babashka` (Rust crate + binary)
- `garden-pod-python` (PyO3)
- `.expr` + `.value` pair format

You’ve created a **new programming substrate**:
- Not tied to any one language
- Values + history + cache first
- REPLs and UIs can be built on top
- Sorter could run *inside* it

Want to mock up `garden-pod-babashka` today?  
I can help write a small crate that:
1. Starts `bb`
2. Sends a bencode `invoke`
3. Gets a result and prints it

It’s barely 100 lines to start.
