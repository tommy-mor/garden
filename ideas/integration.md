Okay, this pushes the integration *even deeper*. If there's no distinct `GardenObject` model, and everything flowing through your custom interpreter/engine *is* fundamentally a `PyObject` (managed via `pyo3` handles), then Garden essentially becomes:

**Garden: A Python Metaruntime / Execution Engine**

Instead of a separate language interpreter that *calls into* Python via FFI, Garden *itself* operates directly on Python's core object representations.

Here's the breakdown of this "PyObjects All The Way Down" approach:

1.  **Core Engine (Rust):**
    *   **Input:** Parses Python code (using Tree-sitter or maybe Python's `ast` via `pyo3`). The resulting AST directly represents Python operations.
    *   **Execution Logic:** This is still Garden's unique part. It walks the AST, but instead of interpreting custom Garden operations, it interprets Python operations.
        *   **Expression IDs & Dependencies:** Tracks structural identity and builds the dependency graph based on the Python AST.
        *   **Caching Layer:** The cache stores `ExpressionID -> PyObject`. It needs a robust way to serialize/deserialize arbitrary `PyObject`s (e.g., using `pickle` via `pyo3`, or potentially more specialized methods for common types like NumPy arrays).
        *   **Interpreter Loop:** When evaluating an AST node (e.g., for `c = a + b`):
            1.  Check cache for the node's ID. If valid `PyObject` exists, return it.
            2.  Ensure dependencies (`a` and `b`) are computed. Recursively evaluate their AST nodes, resulting in `PyObject` handles `py_a` and `py_b`.
            3.  Execute the *Python operation*: Use `pyo3`'s C-API bindings to call the appropriate Python function for addition (`PyNumber_Add` or similar) directly on `py_a` and `py_b`. This requires acquiring the GIL.
            4.  The result is a *new* `PyObject`, `py_c`.
            5.  Store `py_c` (or its serialized form) in the cache against the node's ID.
            6.  Return the `py_c` handle.
    *   **"Object Model":** The engine's internal "value" representation *is* just `PyObject` handles managed by `pyo3`. All primitive operations (like addition, attribute access, function calls) ultimately resolve to calls into the Python C-API via `pyo3`.

2.  **Library Interaction (`import numpy`, `numpy.dot`):**
    *   `import numpy`: The Garden engine sees the import node. It calls `PyModule::import("numpy")` via `pyo3`, gets a `PyObject` for the module, caches it against the import node's ID, and returns the `PyObject` handle.
    *   `numpy.dot(a, b)`:
        1.  Evaluate the `numpy` node (gets the module `PyObject` from cache/import).
        2.  Evaluate the `.dot` access (calls `PyObject_GetAttrString` via `pyo3` on the module `PyObject`, gets the `dot` function `PyObject`).
        3.  Evaluate `a` and `b` (gets their `PyObject` handles).
        4.  Call the `dot` function `PyObject` with `a` and `b` `PyObject` arguments using `PyObject_Call` via `pyo3`.
        5.  Get the result `PyObject`, cache it against the `numpy.dot(a,b)` expression node, and return it.

**Implications:**

*   **Maximum Python Compatibility:** You are literally manipulating Python objects using (close to) Python's own mechanisms. Every Python library *should* work natively because you're interacting with it at the C-API level, just like the standard CPython interpreter does.
*   **Garden = Python with a Different Execution Strategy:** Garden is no longer a separate language at all. It's Python code executed under a novel, caching, dependency-aware engine built directly on the CPython C-API.
*   **Simpler Internal State (Maybe):** The engine only needs to track one fundamental value type: `PyObject` handles.
*   **Performance?:** Could be faster than string-based evaluation if `pyo3` calls are efficient. Could be slower if the overhead of the Garden engine's logic (caching, dependency checks, acquiring/releasing GIL frequently for small operations) outweighs the benefits for simple code. Highly dependent on implementation details.
*   **Tight Coupling:** You are completely tied to the CPython C-API and its object model. Changes in Python versions could require significant Garden engine updates.
*   **Complexity Shift:** The complexity moves from defining a Garden object model and FFI bindings to intricately managing `PyObject` lifecycles, reference counting (although `pyo3` helps massively here), GIL handling, and the logic for mapping AST nodes directly to C-API calls.
*   **Serialization is King:** Robustly serializing/deserializing arbitrary `PyObject`s for the cache becomes absolutely critical and potentially complex (handling C extensions, closures, generators, etc.).

**Analogy:**

Imagine replacing your car's Engine Control Unit (ECU). The engine (CPython C-API / objects) is the same, the sensors (AST analysis) feed into it, but the custom Garden ECU uses advanced predictive caching and dependency analysis to decide *exactly* when to inject fuel, fire sparks, etc. (execute C-API operations), aiming for a different kind of efficiency (developer workflow speed and incremental computation) rather than just raw execution speed.

This feels like the most "Python-native" way to achieve the Garden workflow, effectively creating a specialized Python interpreter focused on caching and interactive development.
