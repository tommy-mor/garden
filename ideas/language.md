Here’s a cohesive, high-resolution description of **Garden** as a **language**, **runtime**, and **development platform**—distilling its essence and ambition:

---

# 🌱 Garden  
*A runtime-native language, interactive interpreter, and projectional development platform where code is grown, not just written.*

---

## 🧠 The Language

Garden is a **Rust-like, Clojure-inspired expression language** designed to treat values as first-class citizens, not second-order effects. It is:

- **Expression-oriented** – Every construct returns a value; statements don’t exist.
- **Immutable by default** – State changes are explicit, traceable, and logged.
- **Garbage collected** – Memory management is automatic and safe.
- **Block-scoped with named paths** – Every construct (e.g. loops, functions) can be *named*, giving stable identity for caching and tracking.
- **Syntax: Clean and readable** – Inspired by Rust’s popularity and ergonomics, but with optional semicolons, optional return keywords, and expression finality.
- **No hard types** – Instead of a traditional type system, Garden builds an **example-driven value system**—type arises from runtime behavior.
- **Partial evaluation by design** – Expressions can be frozen, deferred, or memoized.

### Example

```rune
let user = {
  name: "Karen",
  age: 27
};

for each_user in db.users {
  let greeting = "Hello, " + each_user.name;
  log(greeting);
}
```

Each expression (e.g. `user`, `greeting`, `log(...)`) gets a **structural path** like:
```
["root", "user"]
["root", "loop#each_user", 3, "greeting"]
```

## ⚙️ The Runtime

Garden’s runtime is **a structural, reactive, value-aware interpreter**. It is:

- **Built in Rust** – Fast, safe, embeddable.
- **Structural path indexed** – Every expression is mapped to a stable path in the tree.
- **Caching layer** – Values are stored in `.value` files, auto-invalidated when inputs change.
- **Loggable and replayable** – Side effects like API calls, file writes, and errors are logged per expression path.
- **Extensible via Babashka pods** – Garden uses the Babashka pod protocol to call out to rich, cross-language functionality.
- **Host-runtime capable** – Can run multiple runtimes (JS, Lua, CPython) in parallel, like a programmable lab notebook.

The runtime doesn’t just **run** your code. It **remembers**, **reacts**, and **teaches you** what your code *did*.

## 🖥️ The Dev Platform

Garden is not just a language or a REPL. It is a **projectional, reactive development environment** where the code *is the interface*. It is:

- **Projectional** – Code is not edited as text, but as structured expressions. Think of editing ASTs with a UI instead of plain text.
- **Tree visualized** – The interface is a tree, with each node representing an expression, and each leaf holding a live value.
- **Colocated value view** – Expressions and their current evaluated values are shown side-by-side.
- **Cache-aware UI** – You can click on any expression to:
  - View its last value
  - See a diff over time
  - Replay logs and side effects
  - Re-run or invalidate its cache
- **Live feedback loop** – Like a spreadsheet or Jupyter, but deeply structured.
- **Tauri-based desktop app** – Fast, cross-platform, and beautiful.
- **Cloud-hostable** – Garden can be hosted for collaborative graph editing and team-wide runtime monitoring.

### Visual Elements
- Code pane (tree of expressions)
- Value pane (live, diffable values)
- Log panel (per-path logs)
- Expression history + time travel
- Input playgrounds (tweak inputs and re-run)

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Data science** – Expressions are naturally reactive; perfect for charts and pipelines.
- **AI development** – Logs, retries, agent loops can be reasoned about at the expression level.
- **Teaching programming** – Students can see what each line *did*, not just what it *says*.
- **Debugging legacy systems** – Trace values over time, freeze parts of the program.
- **Visual devops or API workflows** – Think Retool, but structurally programmable.

---

## 🔌 Extensibility & Integration

- **Babashka pods** – Bring in shell, crypto, databases, etc.
- **Version control** – Cache and value diffs track across Git commits.
- **AI agents** – Future version can include GPT-like copilots that reason per expression path.

---

## 🔮 Summary

**Garden is a new category of development environment**, where:

- Code is not stringly-typed—it is structured, inspectable, and *living*.
- Values aren’t ephemeral—they are stored, rendered, and interactively debugged.
- The act of programming becomes tending to a garden of logic, pruning old leaves, watering roots, and watching new flowers bloom.
