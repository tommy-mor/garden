## ðŸŒ± Why a Full Projectional Editor Would Be *Awesome* (But Too Heavy for Now)

In an ideal world, Garden would be built as a **full-blown projectional editor**, maybe even inside a game engine like **Bevy**, because:

- **ðŸ§  Perfect control over AST rendering**: Every expression is a node. You can render values inline, visually compose trees, create custom interaction modes.
- **ðŸŒ³ Expression-level UX**: You could animate changes, trace dependencies visually, drag & drop scopes, or zoom into nested expressions like a 3D model.
- **ðŸŽ® Input model**: Game engines give you fine-grained event handling, hotkeys, spatial logicâ€”perfect for manipulating trees with smooth, reactive feedback.
- **ðŸ§© Plugin system**: A game engine could support custom inspector panels, docked views, and even **runtime simulation alongside source code**.
- **ðŸš€ Long-term power**: This becomes the *Blender* of codeâ€”visual, modular, immersive, powerful. A fully embodied Garden.

## ðŸ˜© Why We're Not Building That Right Now

Despite how dreamy it sounds, going full Bevy/editor engine comes with immense cost:

- **Too much surface area**: You'd have to build AST editing, layout rendering, zoom/navigation, undo/redo, file management... just to get started.
- **You reinvent the editor**: Syntax highlighting, selection, copy/paste, even basic text inputâ€”all have to be rebuilt.
- **Harder AI interop**: AI copilots work best in text buffers. You lose LSP support, autocomplete, and other ecosystem wins.
- **Slower feedback loop**: Shipping, iterating, and onboarding devs becomes dramatically harder.

So we take a more focused, pragmatic path:

## âœ… What We're Actually Doing: Garden as a Smart Runtime Layer on Real Files

We're targeting a *text-first, AST-powered environment* that integrates beautifully into the developer's current workflow.

### ðŸ’¡ The Architecture:

| Layer | Tech | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Editor** | Any text editor (VSCode, Emacs, etc.) | Familiar authoring environment |
| **Parser** | [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) | Extract structured AST from `.expr` files |
| **Runtime** | Rust interpreter | Evaluate expressions, store/cache values |
| **Watcher** | Filewatcher | Detect changes and trigger re-evaluation |
| **UI** | Ratatui TUI | Display cached values, provide cache CRUD interface |

### ðŸš€ Why This Is Better *Now*:

- **You keep your editor** â€“ No new text input engine to build.
- **Tree-sitter gives us AST for free** â€“ Efficient, incremental parsing.
- **Simple TUI shows runtime state** â€“ Shows cached values and allows cache inspection/manipulation.
- **Interpreted runtime means fast iteration** â€“ No need to recompile.
- **Composable stack** â€“ Each layer (editor, parser, runtime, UI) is pluggable and open.

## ðŸŒ± Garden Grows Later

We can still *evolve* toward projectional editing:

- Start with text + AST viewer
- Later: editable AST nodes (JSON tree-style)
- Later: inline editing UI
- Later: full editor replacement with zoomable tree surfaces

But for now, we get:
- Fast feedback loop
- Easy developer adoption
- Focused scope
- MVP we can actually finish
