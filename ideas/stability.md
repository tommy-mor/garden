why do we need stability between expressions, and how can we acheive that? uuid annotations? fully projectional editor (too hard, trying to avoid), maybe keys in a json file (or rocksdb database) of [filename, functionname, depth, variablename] and those _MUST_ be unique, as a linting error. thats enough stability probably. only those things are cached and visible, not every subexpression (to save memory?) 

You're tapping into one of the deepest and most crucial design questions of EVRE:

🌳 How do we ensure that values remain anchored to the same expression over time, even as code changes?

This is essential to the Garden/EVRE vision because the whole point is to "tend" code like a garden—where values accumulate and evolve attached to stable expression paths.

🧠 Why Do We Need Expression Stability?
Here’s a breakdown of why stability matters:

✅ 1. Persistent Value Memory
Without stable identities, every edit would wipe out previously computed values. You couldn't “watch a value grow” or keep runtime insights across edits.

✅ 2. Selective Caching and Evaluation
To avoid recomputing everything, you need to know which expression’s value was already computed and whether it can be reused.

✅ 3. Debugging and Tracing
If you're inspecting why a result changed (or didn’t), you need a stable identity to track a value’s history.

✅ 4. UX Coherence
The entire Garden idea (UI shows values next to expressions) only works if we can match expressions across time—so that editing code doesn’t make the UI flicker or detach from cached insights.

🧩 How Can We Achieve Stability?
Here are the methods you’re already considering, along with pros, cons, and potential refinements:

🔐 Option 1: UUID Annotations (Hidden Metadata)
evre
Copy
Edit
let x = 3 // @uuid=9b2a4f
✅ Pros:
Universally unique

Works across arbitrary tree restructuring

❌ Cons:
Hard to hand-edit or maintain

Not very human-meaningful

Breaks if removed (or creates hard-to-debug mismatches)

🧠 Verdict:
Good for low-level or internal use, but not ideal as the main mechanism. Could be a fallback or auto-generated behind the scenes for advanced recovery.

🏷️ Option 2: Semantic Keys (Structured ID Paths)
You're proposing something like this:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[filename, function_name, loop_label, depth, variable_name]
→ This becomes the expression's identity key, something like:

json
Copy
Edit
["main.gdn", "calculateSquares", "loop1", 2, "x"]
This is extremely promising.

✅ Pros:
Human-meaningful

Easy to debug and display

Makes linting and enforcement feasible

Trivial to generate/validate deterministically

❌ Cons:
Requires user discipline (or tooling) to maintain uniqueness

Doesn’t survive reordering or renaming unless keys are updated (can be okay)

🧠 Verdict:
Best choice for MVP. You get stability and semantic traceability. You can lint for collisions and only cache values for expressions with full identity.

This matches your Garden metaphor: like labeling rows in a spreadsheet—you define what’s tracked.

🖼️ Option 3: Fully Projectional Editor
Full projectional editing could store per-node metadata directly in the tree—no need to worry about stability because structure is maintained.

✅ Pros:
Solves the problem perfectly

Enables rich semantic editing

❌ Cons:
Extremely hard to build

Kills CLI/git/text editing unless you also serialize to readable text

Overkill for a first version

🧠 Verdict:
Out of scope for now. However, you might mimic projectional properties via deterministic syntax + metadata tracking.

📁 Option 4: External Database of Keys/Values (RocksDB?)
Store all known keys (derived from expression locations) in a fast local DB, like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  ["main.gdn", "calculateSquares", "loop1", 2, "x"]: 16
}
✅ Pros:
Fast read/write

Doesn’t bloat code files

Easy to cache values of only “registered” expressions

❌ Cons:
Adds external state (must be versioned or invalidated on syntax change)

Requires deterministic mapping from source to key

🧠 Verdict:
This pairs perfectly with Option 2 above. The semantic key is the address, RocksDB is the cache.

🔄 Final Model: Semantic Keys + Value Cache
Here’s the minimal, stable plan:

💾 Identity Schema
Every value you want to cache must live at an expression annotated by:

cpp
Copy
Edit
[filename, function_name, loop_label (optional), variable_name (optional), depth]
Use comments or syntax like:

evre
Copy
Edit
let result = doThing(x) // @key: main::calculate::loop1::result
Or even implicit derivation via structured code, if naming is required.

🧪 Linting & Enforced Uniqueness
Keys must be unique and complete to be valid.

If not unique, you get a lint error.

If missing, expression is ignored (no caching).

🧠 Cache Strategy
Cache only values for key-tagged expressions.

Evict old keys if their path no longer exists.

Track value history over time, optionally with timestamps/versioning.

✨ Bonus: Visual UI Flow
Only key-tagged expressions show value overlays in the UI.

Clicking on a value shows:

Key

Cached value(s)

Evaluation trace

"Forget value" or "Force re-eval" options

📌 TL;DR
You need stable keys to persist values across edits. The best way to achieve that without a full projectional editor is:

✅ Define semantic identity keys ([file, func, label, var])

✅ Enforce uniqueness via linter

✅ Cache only values with valid keys in something like RocksDB

✅ Limit visible expressions to "named" ones to save memory and clarify focus

✅ Treat everything else as ephemeral

Would you like a demo JSON schema for the keys + value DB structure? Or a sketch of the code that parses an EVRE file and extracts identity keys?
