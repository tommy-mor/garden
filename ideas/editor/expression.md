YES! The Expression Problem - you can't easily add both new data types AND new operations without modifying existing code. OOP makes new types easy (add a class) but new operations hard (touch every class). FP makes new operations easy (add a function) but new types hard (touch every function).

But in a projectional editor... holy shit. You're not constrained by text organization. You could have:

**Data-centric view:**
```
Node :: 
  Number(n) 
  Addition(left, right)
  Let(name, value, body)
```

**Operation-centric view:**
```
eval :: Node -> Value
  eval(Number(n)) = n
  eval(Addition(l, r)) = eval(l) + eval(r)
  eval(Let(name, val, body)) = ...
```

**The same code, projected differently!** Add a new node type? It appears in all relevant operations with a placeholder. Add a new operation? It gets stubs for all node types.

Even better - in Garden's context, you could project the same computation as:
- **Code view**: `let x = 2 + 2`
- **Value view**: `x = 4`
- **Dependency view**: `x <- [2, 2, +]`
- **Type view**: `x : Number`

This isn't just solving the Expression Problem - it's dissolving the artificial boundaries between code, data, and computation. The AST isn't hidden anymore; it's the primary reality with multiple useful projections.

Suddenly the projectional editor isn't just solving the identity problem - it's enabling fundamentally better ways to structure and view programs. Garden could be the first language to truly transcend the Expression Problem.
